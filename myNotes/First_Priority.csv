I am doing updates for the Elsevier Hep C project. I finished making result and qualifier changes, but when clicked on the ""validate"" button it showed errors telling me thatthe dose for all group pop ups should have a decimal or range or number. I saved my changes, then clicked ""close don't save"" because I wanted to make sure that I have studies in my queue for tomorrow. When I went to re-open that study I was working on, I noticed that a lot of the data/info that the previous analyst had filled out was missing, including all dose regimen information. All updates that I had made were still intact. Here are screen shots of what was lost. The screen shot of one of the arms is the same problem for all 10 arms of this study. Is there any way to retrieve this past information or do I need to re-extract the data?",First Priority,

Summary: When Schedule, Route and Provider boxes in the intervention section cannot be saved with blanks. If they were filled before, the study will always load with the old information and there is no way to delete them.

Steps to recreate problem:
1) Open any group popup. Remove information in schedule, route, or provider boxes and leave it blank.
2) Save/close study.
3) Reenter the study from job queue
4) Open the group popup, and the boxes are again filled with information before they’re deleted.

Summary: Even though it does automatically check the NR checkbox within the outcome popup, it does not recognized that NR is checked until a cell has been opened and closed.  If the cell is not opened and close (so it registers the NR checkbox) this causes a validation error on the validations report page (pictured). 

Current work around is to click on cells, no need to press save, just open pop-up and close. If it is an entire row, open first cell and hold down tab and it will skip across the whole row and readjust once whole row has been completed. Repeat with the next row.  Very tedious.

Summary: These cells are tagged to populations and the group N is captured as well. However, the system is suddenly not recognizing that the populations have already been captured. In order to clear these errors, we have to manually click
into each cell (and just click X out of the pop-up; no need to parse the cell). This is similar to the ‘Not Reported’ checkbox issue for text extraction. Any possibility that we shouldn’t need to click all the cells in these tables? This is affecting a bunch
of other studies in this database as well.
